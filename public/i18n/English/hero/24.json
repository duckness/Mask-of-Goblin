He entered the church with the help of the High Priest Berman, but the religious life was painfully ill-suited for him. One day, however, he suddenly decided to quit his deviant ways, and started following the path of the high priesthood.",

According to the legend, this book, guarded throughout the ages by the Grand Priests of the church, was written by Lua herself. Iris, the current Grand Priest, upon receiving a revelation regarding Baudouin, entrusted this book to his step father, Berman. Later, the book was given to Baudouin when he became a high priest. It is said that this divine relic provides infinite holy energy to its owner, along with the power to unlock the true potential of those who have faith."
