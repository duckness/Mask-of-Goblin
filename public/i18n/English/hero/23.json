Unfortunately, the warrior is said to have been defeated by Morrah. No one has seen this legendary gear since then. That is, until Morrah reappeared on the front line."

The beast smelt a sealing stone from Morrah, lost control, emerged from the lava, and dashed directly to her. Morrah, however, did not hesitate to stab its eyes with Carprain, and a completely different type of heat shriveled Belzebuna and absorbed its body. Looking at its entire body being crushed and the last eye wriggling on the ground, Morrah stuck it on her shield to mock the beast."
