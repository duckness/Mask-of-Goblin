Once he engages in a combat, though, he turns into an untouchable silver wolf that storms across the battlefield. Nothing is known about his past. One thing is certain: he does not distinguish between friend and foe once the madness of battle takes over him. Staying near him when he's in this state may be far more dangerous than holding onto a ticking time bomb.",
