  "story": "Penteonia is an impenetrable kingdom. Even the Demon Army could not breach its defense 100 years ago. Ruling over this iron kingdom is Artemia, the Empress of Light. Ever since childhood, she has lived under the weight of responsibility of the throne she would eventually inherit. When she finally realized that the victory of her kingdom was only made possible by the sacrifices of her people, she swore to never hide from her duties. She would face the pressure of royal responsibility with courage. Penteonia has historically been a selfish kingdom, only interested in its own safety. Now, with Artemia as its ruler, everything is about to change.",
